List Pagination project for Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree

The List Pagination project is a project that explores the use of only vanilla javascript (ES6). It is a page that displays students and their info based on the current page number selected.

As a current software engineer, this was a fun challenge to just get back to basics! I sprinkled in as much ES6 as I could. I used the current skills that I had along with the content that I learned from this journey so far.
